; For Heat_tower_190-240_Bridge.stl
; Reduce temperature every 5mm (20 layers for 0.25mm layer height). Start from 260C, not the stl file says 240C. My nozzle is 0.6mm and requires higher temerature.
; Set layer height to 0.25mm. If larger, some bridges are skipped.
; Below varibles are for PrusaSlicer. You need to find their equivalant for other slicers like Cura.
; layer_z is heigh in mm, not layer sequence index 1, 2, 3 etc. Layer 0's layer_z is 0.25mm, layer 1's is 0.5mm... layer 19's is 5mm.
; Current layer_z: {layer_z}
; Current: int(((layer_z-0.25) / 5)): {int(((layer_z-0.25) / 5))}
M104 S{260 - (5 * int( ((layer_z-0.25) / 5) ))}
